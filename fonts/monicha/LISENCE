"Hello, I am french and
I worked on your font MONICHA with the aim of making an embroiderable font.
this work, if you agree, will be usable in the free software inkstitch (https://inkstitch.org/fr/) witch is an extention of inskape (inskape.org).
I will not sell my work, it will be a free job for inkstitch
I need your permission to use it, and let others users use it in embordering. (personnel use and commercial use)
 I give you one picture of my embordering work, it's a first test.
Are you agree, with that project ? if you're agree do you have any restrictions to propose, on the name or the use?
thanks for your attention"
