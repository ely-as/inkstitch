The author "Octavian" has been contacted by Tina Chris:
"Dear Octavian,
We would like to use an embroidery-adapted version of your font in an official release of Inkstitch (https://inkstitch.org/fonts/font-library/). The license does not clearly state if this is allowed. So we would kindly ask if you would allow it? If yes, should we put something special in the license, or change the name?
Thanks
Tina"

Octavian Codrea accepted the use of the Dinomouse font in a mail:
"Hi Tina
Glad to see this litle project I made a few years ago has people who enjoy it. You're free to use it for Inkstitch however you like. The only thing I'd ask of you is to mention me as the original designer and eventually have a link to the 1001fonts or 1001freefonts page in the font license.

Best,
Octav"
